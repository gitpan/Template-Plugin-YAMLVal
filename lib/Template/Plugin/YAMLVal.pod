=head1 NAME

Template::Plugin::YAMLVal - yamlval vmethod for Template Toolkit

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    [% USE YAMLVal %]
    foo: [% foo.yamlval %]
    bar: [% bar.yamlval %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module lets you use Template Toolkit to write out YAML mapping files in a
certain top level key order, while making sure that the keys are properly YAML
encoded.

There may be other use cases, but that's the one that drove me to write this.
